# solid_software_test_app

A Solid Software Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a test task to the Solid Software.
Implemented basic functions:
* Display the text "Hey there" in the middle of screen
* Change the background color to a random color

Other feature:
* Changing the background color by swinging the smartphone to the side (X axis)
* Inversion of the inscription on the middle screen relative to the background (to counteract color merging)
* Changed font and caption style in the middle screen
